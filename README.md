# Crime in Baltimore
## Ongoing exploration into visualizing crime statistics

This is an effort to explore and visualize crime data. The Baltimore PD publishes their statistics in an acessable way. 
I intend to (eventually) adapt the framework for other cities, as they continue to improve their access to crime data.
